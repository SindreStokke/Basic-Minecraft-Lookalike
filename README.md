# Basic Minecraft Lookalike

This is a basic Minecraft lookalike made from scratch with Godot 3.2.1. While the goal originally was to make it as close to Minecraft as possible, I have gotten second thoughts as I do not want to infringe on Microsoft's and Mojang Studios intellectual property. This makes the future of this project uncertain.

Added functionalities:
- Procedurally generated world with customizable height, render distance, blocks and tree frequency (as variables at the top of the "Verden"-script).
- Character movement, including jumping, crouching and sprinting.
- Ability to destroy and place blocks.


Lacking functionalities (at least the most critical):
- Ability to continously load more terrain as you move around.
- Ability to choose what blocks to place down.
- Different biomes
- Water physics
- Performance optimization
- Saving and loading the world
- Multiplayer
